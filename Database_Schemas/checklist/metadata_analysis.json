  "suggested_semantic_schema": "DOMAIN OVERVIEW\n- This database powers an internal operations platform with modules:\n  1) Checklist tasks (recurring tasks) and Delegation tasks (one-off assignments)\n  2) Task completion/extension history (delegation_done)\n  3) User management and access control (users, users_staging)\n  4) Store & Purchase indents / approvals (indent, indent_requests, indent_items, indent_approvals)\n  5) GRN bill approval workflow (store_grn)\n  6) Repair gate-pass follow-up tracking (repair_followup)\n  7) Visitor gate-pass and approvals (visitors, person_to_meet)\n  8) Reference data: departments, systems, working_day_calender\n\nENTITY NOTES (HOW TO QUERY)\n- Users are identified by users.id, but many operational tables store user_name text in columns like name / given_by / approved_by. Joins may require matching on users.user_name (string join), not users.id.\n- Departments are stored as free text in many tables; optionally map to departments.department.\n\nTASKS: CHECKLIST VS DELEGATION\n- checklist: recurring operational task occurrences.\n  - Key fields: task_id, department, name (assignee), given_by (assigner), frequency, planned_date (TEXT), task_start_date, submission_date, user_status_checklist, admin_done, delay.\n  - Interpretation:\n    - user_status_checklist indicates user completion (Pending/Yes/No).\n    - admin_done indicates administrative verification.\n    - delay is lateness vs planned.\n- delegation: one-off delegated tasks.\n  - Key fields: task_id, department, name, given_by, planned_date, task_start_date, submission_date, status, delay.\n  - delegation_done is the event log for delegation status changes.\n\nDELEGATION HISTORY\n- delegation_done: multiple rows per delegation.task_id; newest created_at is latest event.\n  - status in delegation_done can be done/completed/extend.\n  - next_extend_date used when status='extend'.\n\nTIME DIMENSION\n- working_day_calender can be used to roll up by working_date, week_num, month.\n  - Many task tables use TIMESTAMP while checklist.planned_date is TEXT; cast as timestamp when needed.\n\nSTORE & PURCHASE (INDENTS)\n- indent: appears to hold detailed line-level indent records including item_code/product_name/qty and request_status.\n- indent_requests + indent_items: a more normalized header/line model (may be unused currently; sample empty).\n- indent_approvals: approvals per indent_id (likely maps to indent.id or indent_requests.id depending on implementation; use indent_id semantics carefully).\n\nGRN WORKFLOW\n- store_grn: GRN/bill tracking.\n  - approval flags: sended_bill, approved_by_admin, approved_by_gm, close_bill.\n\nVISITOR GATE PASS\n- visitors: one row per visit.\n  - status: IN/OUT; approval_status: pending/approved; gate_pass_closed boolean.\n  - person_to_meet is a text name; can be mapped to person_to_meet.person_to_meet.\n\nSYSTEMS NAVIGATION\n- systems: list of modules and links; users.system_access lists module entitlements as comma-separated text.\n\nCOMMON ANALYTICS QUESTIONS (SUPPORTED)\n- Overdue tasks: filter checklist/delegation where submission_date is null and planned_date/task_start_date < now().\n- Delay reporting: use delay interval; for checklist you may need to compute delay if null using submission_date - task_start_date.\n- Completion rates by department/user: group by department, name with status fields (delegation.status; checklist.user_status_checklist/admin_done).\n- Approval throughput: indent.request_status and store_grn approval flags over time.\n\nDATA QUALITY / NORMALIZATION CAVEATS\n- status and categorical fields vary by case (Done vs done; Yes vs yes). Normalize using LOWER() for comparisons.\n- checklist.planned_date is TEXT; cast to timestamp for date logic.\n- Many references are denormalized strings (names/departments). Prefer robust joins (case-insensitive) or maintain mapping tables if possible."
