The schema indicates multiple modules stitched together, with many \u2018FKs\u2019 implemented as free-text names/codes rather than strict relational keys, plus some duplicated/legacy tables (e.g., users vs users_staging vs login; re_coile vs re_coiler; enquiry tracking in several tables).",

  "suggested_semantic_schema": "DOMAIN OVERVIEW\n- This is a multi-module internal operations database for a manufacturing company.\n- Major functional areas:\n  1) Tasking: checklist, delegation, housekeeping/area tasks, maintenance tasks.\n  2) Sales CRM: leads/enquiries tracking, quotations, client master and follow-ups.\n  3) Store & Purchase: indents, approvals, GRN, repair follow-up.\n  4) HR/Admin: users & access control, leave requests, visitor gate pass, travel/resource requests, recruitment.\n  5) Subscriptions & Documents: subscription lifecycle with approvals, payments, renewals; document repository and sharing.\n  6) Plant operations logs: SMS/CCM/pipe mill/QC checklists.\n\nKEY ENTITIES (CANONICAL NAMES)\n- Employee/User: users (id, user_name, employee_id, department, role, access fields)\n- Department: departments (id, department)\n- Location/Area: locations (location_id, location)\n- Delegated Task: delegation (task_id, given_by, name, department, planned_date, submission_date, status, delay)\n- Delegation Event/Audit: delegation_done (id uuid, task_id, status, created_at, next_extend_date)\n- Checklist Task Instance: checklist (task_id, frequency, planned_date, task_start_date, submission_date, status/admin_done)\n- Housekeeping/Area Task: assign_task (id, department=area/location, frequency, task_start_date, submission_date, status)\n- Maintenance Task: maintenance_task_assign (id, task_no, serial_no, machine_name, task_start_date, actual_date, task_status, priority, maintenance_cost)\n- Asset Registry: form_responses (id, serial_no/tag_no, machine_name, department, maintenance_schedule)\n- Indent (Store Request): indent (id, request_number, requester_name, item_code, request_qty, request_status, approved_quantity)\n- Indent Approval: indent_approvals (id, indent_id, approver_id, status, approval_date)\n- GRN Bill: store_grn (grn_no, grn_date, party_bill_amount, approved_by_admin, approved_by_gm, close_bill)\n- Repair Gatepass Follow-up: repair_followup (gate_pass_no, planned/actual delays, stage statuses)\n- Lead/Enquiry:\n  - fms_leads (lead_no) for lead intake\n  - enquiry_to_order (en_enquiry_no) for enquiry-to-order pipeline\n  - enquiry_tracker for follow-up logs (note: enquiry_no mixes EN and LD)\n- Quotation: make_quotation (quotation_no, quotation_date, items jsonb, pdf_url, grand_total)\n- Client: clients (client_id, client_name, sales_person_id)\n- Client Follow-up: client_followups (followup_id, client_name, sales_person, date_of_calling)\n- Visitor Gate Pass: visitors (id, visitor_name, date_of_visit, approval_status, status IN/OUT)\n- Person-to-meet master: person_to_meet\n- Leave Request: leave_request (id, employee_id, from_date, to_date, request_status)\n- Subscription: subscription (subscription_no, start_date, end_date, approval_status)\n- Subscription Approval History: approval_history (approval_no, subscription_no)\n- Subscription Payments: payment_history (subscription_no, payment_mode, transaction_id)\n- Subscription Renewals: subscription_renewals (subscription_no, renewal_no)\n- Document: documents (document_id, serial_no, document_name, category, renewal_date)\n- Document Sharing Log: sharedocuments\n\nJOIN/RELATIONSHIP GUIDANCE (IMPORTANT FOR TEXT-TO-SQL)\n- Many relationships are NOT enforced with foreign keys; joins frequently require matching on text fields:\n  - users.user_name is referenced as given_by/name/sales_person_name in many tables.\n  - users.employee_id is referenced by leave_request.employee_id and HR/travel/ticket modules.\n  - departments.department is referenced as plain text in users.department, checklist.department, delegation.department, indent.department.\n  - locations.location is referenced as assign_task.department (area-based naming).\n- Subscription-related joins:\n  - subscription.subscription_no = approval_history.subscription_no = payment_history.subscription_no = subscription_renewals.subscription_no\n- Indent approvals:\n  - indent_approvals.indent_id likely = indent.id\n- Maintenance asset link:\n  - maintenance_task_assign.serial_no often matches form_responses.serial_no or form_responses.tag_no\n\nMETRICS & ANALYTICS READY FIELDS\n- Task timeliness: delegation.delay, checklist.delay, maintenance_task_assign.delay, indent.time_delay_1, subscription.time_delay_1/2/3.\n- Completion rates: status fields (Done/Yes/no etc.). Normalize casing for analysis.\n- SLA comparisons: planned vs actual fields across sales, subscriptions, indents, repair followup.\n- Sales pipeline: lead_source, enquiry_status, current_stage, followup_status, is_order_received.\n\nDATA QUALITY / NORMALIZATION NOTES\n- Status and frequency values have inconsistent casing and sometimes different types (text vs boolean).\n- Several date/time fields are stored as TEXT in some tables (fms_leads, enquiry_tracker, checklist.planned_date).\n- leads_tracker appears corrupted/unreliable; prefer fms_leads and enquiry_to_order/enquiry_tracker for CRM reporting.\n- Duplicate/legacy tables exist (login vs users; re_coile vs re_coiler). Prefer users and re_coiler.\n\nSUGGESTED CANONICAL DIMENSIONS FOR A TEXT-TO-SQL AGENT\n- dim_user(user_id, user_name, employee_id, department, role)\n- dim_department(department)\n- dim_location(location)\n- dim_date(working_day_calender)\n\nSUGGESTED CANONICAL FACT TABLES\n- fact_delegation_task(delegation)\n- fact_delegation_event(delegation_done)\n- fact_checklist_task(checklist)\n- fact_area_task(assign_task)\n- fact_maintenance_task(maintenance_task_assign)\n- fact_indent(indent) and fact_indent_approval(indent_approvals)\n- fact_grn(store_grn)\n- fact_repair_followup(repair_followup)\n- fact_lead(fms_leads) and fact_enquiry(enquiry_to_order) and fact_enquiry_updates(enquiry_tracker)\n- fact_quotation(make_quotation)\n- fact_subscription(subscription) with related approval_history/payment_history/subscription_renewals\n- fact_visitor(visitors)\n- fact_leave(leave_request)\n\nQUERYING TIPS\n- When asked for 'tasks', clarify whether it refers to delegation vs checklist vs maintenance vs assign_task.\n- When joining by person, use consistent name fields and consider trimming/case-insensitive matching.\n- For 'delay', prefer numeric/interval columns where available; otherwise compute from planned/actual after casting text to date."
