The schema indicates multiple modules consolidated into one system with partially overlapping/duplicated tables (e.g., enquiry tracking in several forms, users vs login vs users_staging) and a mix of structured columns plus semi-structured JSON/text fields.",

  "suggested_semantic_schema": "SYSTEM OVERVIEW:\n- This database is a multi-module internal operations platform.\n- Major domains:\n  1) Task Management: checklist (recurring tasks) and delegation (one-off delegated tasks) with completion/extension history in delegation_done.\n  2) Sales CRM: leads and enquiries tracked through enquiry_to_order, enquiry_tracker, fms_leads, clients, client_followups, and quotations in make_quotation. dropdown stores allowed UI values.\n  3) Operations/Production: SMS/CCM/Pipe Mill and QC logs (sms_register, tundish_checklist, hot_coil, re_coiler/re_coile, pipe_mill, qc_lab_samples, laddle_return, laddle_checklist).\n  4) Admin/HR/Store: users, departments, systems, visitors/person_to_meet, leave_request, store_grn, indent (+ approvals/items/requests), repair_followup, travel/ticket_book, generic request, resume_request.\n\nENTITY NOTES & JOIN GUIDANCE (IMPORTANT FOR TEXT-TO-SQL):\n- users(id) is the canonical user identifier, but many tables store person names as TEXT (e.g., delegation.name, delegation.given_by, checklist.name, visitors.approved_by). Prefer name-based joins only when needed and treat them as fuzzy/unenforced.\n- departments.department is referenced by text from users.department, checklist.department, delegation.department.\n- Delegation lifecycle:\n  - delegation.task_id is the task.\n  - delegation_done stores events per task_id with status in (done/completed/extend) and next_extend_date for extensions.\n- Checklist lifecycle:\n  - checklist.task_id represents a scheduled instance (often many rows for a recurring template).\n  - Completion indicators are inconsistent: checklist.status, checklist.user_status_checklist, and checklist.admin_done. Normalize in queries using case-insensitive comparisons.\n- Sales lifecycle:\n  - enquiries exist in multiple forms. Prefer enquiry_to_order for typed dates/booleans; enquiry_tracker is more like history/snapshots and stores many values as TEXT.\n  - fms_leads appears to be an imported lead table with most fields as TEXT.\n  - clients is customer master; client_followups logs calling activity.\n  - make_quotation stores quotation header and items as JSONB.\n- Store/Indent:\n  - indent is line-level with one row per item requested (includes item_code/product_name).\n  - indent_requests + indent_items represent a separate header/items pattern; may be unused/alternate.\n  - indent_approvals logs approvals; approver_id format is ambiguous (could be employee code or login id).\n- Visitor Management:\n  - visitors logs actual entries/exits; person_to_meet is a directory.\n  - plant_visitor represents planned visit requests.\n\nCANONICAL METRICS (RECOMMENDED DEFINITIONS FOR ANALYTICS):\n- Task delay:\n  - delegation.delay is an INTERVAL; negative means early.\n  - checklist.delay is INTERVAL but often null; compute as submission_date - task_start_date or planned_date when planned_date is parseable.\n- Task completion:\n  - Delegation complete when delegation.status ILIKE 'done%' OR latest delegation_done.status in ('done','completed').\n  - Checklist complete when user_status_checklist ILIKE 'yes' OR status ILIKE 'yes'; admin confirmation when admin_done ILIKE 'confirmed%' OR 'done'.\n- Sales conversion:\n  - enquiry_to_order.is_order_received = true indicates order received.\n  - For tracker tables, use is_order_received_status in ('yes') but beware of 'hold'.\n\nDATA QUALITY WARNINGS:\n- Many categorical fields have inconsistent casing and duplicates (Done vs done, Monthly vs monthly). Use LOWER() normalization.\n- Several date/time fields are stored as TEXT in some tables (checklist.planned_date, enquiry_tracker.next_call_date/time, fms_leads.*). Parse carefully or filter to rows where casting succeeds.\n- leads_tracker sample suggests mis-mapped columns; treat it as unreliable unless validated.\n- re_coile and re_coiler appear duplicated; prefer re_coiler if both exist.\n\nEXAMPLE QUERY INTENTS (FOR AGENT):\n- 'Overdue delegated tasks': delegation where planned_date < now and (status not done) and submission_date is null.\n- 'Checklist compliance by department per day': group checklist by department and date(task_start_date) with completion flags.\n- 'Enquiries pending follow-up': enquiry_to_order where next_call_date is not null and is_order_received is not true.\n- 'GRN pending approvals': store_grn where approved_by_admin=false OR approved_by_gm=false OR close_bill=false.\n- 'Indent pending': indent where request_status='PENDING' or gm_approval is null.\n\nNAMING CONVENTIONS (SUGGESTED NORMALIZED LAYER):\n- Normalize person references to user_id where possible; otherwise keep *_name as descriptive.\n- Create views:\n  - v_delegation_current (latest status from delegation + latest delegation_done)\n  - v_checklist_normalized (normalized yes/no, parsed planned_date)\n  - v_enquiry_normalized (prefer enquiry_to_order + optional tracker history)\n"
